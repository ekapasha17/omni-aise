# Build Error Resolution Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: "cn" is not exported by classNames.js during build process

## Root Cause
The `classNames.js` utility file had duplicate export declarations:
1. Individual named exports at the top of functions
2. An additional export object at the bottom that re-exported the same functions

This caused a "Duplicate export" error during the Vite build process.

## Solution Applied
Removed the duplicate export block at the end of `classNames.js`:

```javascript
// REMOVED (was causing duplicate export error):
export {
    classNames,
    conditionalClass,
    mergeClasses,
    cn
};
```

The individual named exports at function declaration level were kept:
- `export function classNames(...)`
- `export function conditionalClass(...)`
- `export function mergeClasses(...)`
- `export function cn(...)`
- `export default cn;`

## Verification
✅ Build now completes successfully with `npm run build`
✅ All absolute imports are working correctly
✅ No duplicate export errors

## Best Practices to Avoid Similar Issues

### 1. Consistent Export Strategy
Choose one export pattern per file:
- **Named exports only**: `export function myFunction() {}`
- **Default export only**: `export default myFunction`
- **Mixed exports**: Named exports + one default export

### 2. Avoid Duplicate Exports
Never re-export the same function/variable in multiple ways:

```javascript
// ❌ BAD - Duplicate exports
export function myFunction() {}
export { myFunction }; // Duplicate!

// ✅ GOOD - Single export
export function myFunction() {}
```

### 3. Testing Exports
Always test your exports work correctly:
- Run `npm run build` after making export changes
- Use `import` statements to verify the exports work as expected

### 4. Import Best Practices
When importing from utilities:

```javascript
// ✅ Named imports (recommended for utilities)
import { cn, classNames } from '@utils/classNames';

// ✅ Default import (if exported as default)
import cn from '@utils/classNames';

// ✅ Namespace import (for large utility files)
import * as classUtils from '@utils/classNames';
```

## Related Files Fixed
- `resources/js/utils/classNames.js` - Removed duplicate exports
- `resources/js/Pages/ExampleAbsoluteImports.jsx` - Working absolute imports
- Build process now works with all absolute import configurations

## Commands to Verify
```bash
# Test build process
npm run build

# Test development server
npm run dev

# Verify git status
git status
```

All absolute imports are now working correctly and the build process completes without errors.
